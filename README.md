Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Research Associate** working to bring AI Technologies to underserved markets (and potentially AGI in the near future!). I have a strong passion for AI research, machine learning, and applied statistics. I'm currently working on various projects, including **An AI Powered Research Platform** aimed to help young researchers come up to speed with the writing process.
